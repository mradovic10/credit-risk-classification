# credit-risk-classification
Module 20 Challenge

For this challenge, I was tasked with training and evaluating two models based on loan risk and identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers. A dataset called 'lending_data', found in the Resources folder, was used for analysis. It compiles historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.

All the analysis for the challenge was performed in the 'credit_risk_classification' Jupyter Notebook using numpy, pandas, pathlib, imblearn, and scikit-learn.
